## A simple app builded with Ember 1.0, Ember-Data and Twitter Bootstrap 

Inspired by the beepcode Ember.js tutorial, I'm trying to decode the new Ember concepts with my apps. Until now, the clear advantages are :    

* Less code and more active code generation (in memory)  based on naming conventions. (Router, Controller, Model, View and Template)

* Large data model create with ember-data.  I have to say this is my favorite feature.  You really can start developing your web app  without any  server.  This create a huge diference, first you can mature the model with the interface, and 
  you can create full working prototypes of your apps.

TODO :

- Create inner views for Catalogues.
- Add require.js to make more modular the code.
- Add Jasmine Unit Tests
- Pre-compile Handlebar Templates
- Minify js and css
